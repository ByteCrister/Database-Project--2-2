# Personal E-Commerce Platform for PC Components

## You should know!
<p>This database project serves as an introduction to the server environment and databases for me. I have recently learned some basic Node.js, Express.js, and EJS components to connect the database with the frontend. Within two weeks, I learned these components and started applying them to this project. Lots of mistakes happened, but more than mistakes, I have gained practical knowledge from this project, which I must apply to my upcoming projects.</p>
