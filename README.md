# Personal E-Commerce Platform for PC Components

## Do you know?
<p>This database project serves as an introduction to the server environment and databases for me. I have recently learned some basic <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Express.js</b>, <b>MySql</b>, and <b>EJS</b> components to connect the database with the frontend. Within two weeks, I learned these components and started applying them to this project. Lots of mistakes happened, but more than mistakes, I have gained practical knowledge from this project, which I must apply to my upcoming projects.</p>
